## Model Summary
Actix Stack is a hybrid backend system built on Rust's Actix framework, supplemented by Node.js and Python microservices. Designed for high-performance web APIs, containerized deployment, and extensible architecture. Supports AI module integration via Neomind services.

## Usage
- Multi-service backend APIs  
- Docker Compose deployment  
- Local development or production  
- Integrate AI/analytics services  

### Input/Output
- Input: HTTP requests, API calls, JSON payloads  
- Output: JSON responses, logs, or service results  

## System
- Standalone Dockerized stack  
- Requires Rust, Node.js, Python runtime in Docker containers  
- Can integrate with external databases or AI services  

## Implementation
- Rust Actix backend  
- Docker + Docker Compose  
- CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions  

## Evaluation
- Performance: high concurrency handling  
- Reliability: production-ready container orchestration  
- Security: environment variables & SSL certificates  

## Limitations & Ethics
- Ensure proper environment configuration  
- Not for untrusted input without validation  
- Sensitive data must be handled securely
